# CatalanNumbers
Creating an algorithm with HTML and Javascript that calculates and displays Catalan Numbers.
Doing this for a teacher that loves Catalan Numbers <3
Few Errors that I'm working on, with displaying the answer and for loop

Update (02/27/22) Completed this mini project,
recursion is annoying on Javascript, but I learned alot.
Also can't calculate big numbers, but I don't mind it since,
I have some more stuff to work on.

Until next time...
